# Starbound JSON Language Support README

A very, very WIP language support extension being worked on by (currently) only myself.

The idea is to create complete support for Starbound JSON in vscode. This includes proper highlighting, error detection, linting, intellisense, autocomplete and schema support.

Thank you for stopping by~

## Known Issues

there is likely many, such as `jsons` barely being a valid language at all inside vsc
